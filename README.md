### 3. Dice Game 🎲

A fun little game where you pick a number and roll the dice — if it matches, you score points!  
Built to practice **styled-components** and keeping styles in the same file as the component.

### 4. Food Ordering Website 🍴

A modern React app where you can browse food items, search, and filter them by category (Breakfast, Lunch, Tea, Dinner).  
Learned how to fetch data, use **React hooks** like `useEffect`, and display results dynamically.
